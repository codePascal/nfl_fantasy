"""
Accumulates all weekly snapcounts for a season into one.

Refreshing means, that it will, regardless if the file already
exists, accumulate the stats again. However, this does not mean that
the stats itself are refreshed.

Running this script will store all summaries for a denoted year
range or refresh them if available offline.
